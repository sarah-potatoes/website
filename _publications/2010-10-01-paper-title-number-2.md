Over 30% of the Earth's ocean crust is created in fast‐spread environments like the East Pacific Rise, but there is no consensus on how the lower portion of the crust is formed and cooled. This is in part because it is difficult to access lower crustal gabbroic samples formed at fast‐spread ridges. Because ocean crustal rocks preserve a record of Earth's magnetic field at the time they cool, we can use magnetic data to help distinguish between different formation models. We use magnetic anomaly data in an exposed section of fast‐spread crust in order to determine the pattern of magnetization variations in these rocks. This new method solves for crustal magnetization over a ~10‐km wide survey area to determine a robust average magnetization of lavas, dikes, and gabbroic rocks. Our magnetizations agree with previous estimates for samples from fast‐spread crust. The survey area also includes a magnetic reversal, and the pattern of magnetization can only be reproduced if there is a large horizontal offset in temperature between the dike and gabbroic rocks, or the gabbroic section cools very slowly (meaning shallow isotherms). This means temperatures remain hotter in the gabbroic section of lower ocean crust further off axis.
